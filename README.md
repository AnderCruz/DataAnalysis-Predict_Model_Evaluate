### Project: Automotive Sector

## Part I - Predict Price
<p>I will develop several models that predict the price of the car using correlations. I create a model to predict the price and give us the ideia how much the car should cost.</p>
Some questions we want to ask.
<ul>
    <li>Do I know if the dealer is offering fair value for my trade-in?</li>
    <li>Do I know if I put a fair value on my car?</li>
</ul>

<p>A model will help us understand the exact relationship between different variables and how these variables are used to predict the result.</p>

## Part II - Model Evaluation and Refinement
