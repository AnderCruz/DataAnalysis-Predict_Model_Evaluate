Part I - Predict Price
I will develop several models that predict the price of the car using correlations. I create a model to predict the price and give us the ideia how much the car should cost.

Some questions we want to ask.
Do I know if the dealer is offering fair value for my trade-in?
Do I know if I put a fair value on my car?
A model will help us understand the exact relationship between different variables and how these variables are used to predict the result.
